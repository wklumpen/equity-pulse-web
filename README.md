# Get Started

To get started, you will want to set up a virtual environment on your system and
make sure you've got your packages set up correctly.

* Clone the project at the appropriate branch.

* In the project directory, run `python venv env` to set up the environments
folder. Then you can activate the shell (if you're on Windows) for the virtual environment with
`env\Scripts\activate`.

* Next, update your python package manager: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

* Then install the packages you need: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will take a bit of time

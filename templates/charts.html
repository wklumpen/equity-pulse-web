    <p class='flow-text'>Public transportation can offer a "ladder of opportunity", providing affordable and convenient connections to jobs, goods and services, medical care, and other essentials of daily life. But pervasive racism and discrimination in land use, transportation, and transit planning have created wide gaps in transit access across race, income, and other characteristics, worsening social inequity.</p>

    <h3 class='left-align'>How long are trips to essential destinations when traveling by transit vs. by car?</h3>

    <p class='flow-text'>One of the most important ways to assess public transit is to measure the access it provides. What can you reach on transit in a given amount of time, and how does that compare to other travel options?</p>

    <p class='flow-text'>Public transit doesn’t need to provide greater access than driving to be useful to large numbers of people. However, transit will meet few people’s needs when it is <i>substantially</i> slower than a car trip. If people are consistently unable to access places using the public transit system, they are more likely to buy private vehicles.</p>
    
    <p class='flow-text'>This chart compares average travel times for each mode for people living in poverty. For each of the following categories, it shows the average travel time by car or transit: the nearest hospital, urgent care facility, and college/university, and the third-nearest grocery store and pharmacy.</p>

        <h3 class='left-align'>How many jobs can people reach in 45 minutes on public transit?</h3>
        <p class='flow-text'>This chart shows the number of jobs that different groups of people can reach on transit in 45 minutes. <b>In most regions, there is a significant racial access gap</b>: The average white resident can access many more jobs using transit compared to the average Black or Latinx resident.</p>
        <p class='flow-text'>Even in regions without this access gap, transit is scarce for many riders. In the {{view['title']}} region, the average resident can access {{ "{:,.0f}".format(view['car_access'])}} jobs in 45 minutes by car, substantially more than by transit. </p>
        <p class='flow-text'>When people are unable to access many jobs using transit, their opportunities in life may be limited. They may have to forgo a job that is a good match for their skills, for instance. Or they may be compelled to take out risky loans to buy and maintain a car.</p>
        <p class='flow-text'>Access is a function of both transportation and land use. In regions where white residents tend to live closer to the central business district, making transit more equitable will entail intentionally accounting for that proximity advantage.</p>
        <p class='flow-text'>(Note: Access to jobs can be a useful proxy for access to other destinations, since many jobs represent retail and service outlets that are important in people’s everyday lives.)</p>

      </div>
      <p class='flow-text'>The pandemic has led to significant transit service changes (see Transit Service Intensity below), which have affected what people can access on transit. This figure shows how the number of jobs accessible in 45 minutes has changed since February 2020.</p>

      <p class='flow-text'>While jobs access has fluctuated for most groups of people, <b>in most regions large racial and income access gaps persisted over the course of the pandemic</b>, even while BIPOC workers were far more likely than white workers to continue commuting. This shows how inequitable access is rooted in segregated land use that isolates some people from job centers, and transit systems that inadequately connect them to those opportunities. Transit service may have changed during the pandemic, but not in ways that overcome the underlying segregation.</p>

      <h2>Transit Service Intensity</h2>
      <p class='flow-text'>Transit agencies regularly adjust schedules, affecting how much transit service people have near home.</p>

  <div class='row'>
      <div class='col s12'>
          <h3 class='left-align'>How has the average hourly number of transit trips serving people near their homes changed?</h3>

          <p class='flow-text'>In most regions, transit agencies cut service during the initial stages of the pandemic, then gradually restored it over time. Within regions, the changes were not uniform -- many agencies maintained or increased service on routes that essential workers rely on. But overall, most people have access to less transit service than they did in February 2020. </p>

          <p class='flow-text'>This chart shows how transit service intensity has changed for different groups over time. Transit service intensity is a function of route density (how many routes are within walking distance) and frequency (how often they run).</p>
              
          <p class='flow-text'>Demographic groups with access to high levels of transit service intensity tend to have short rides to neighborhood destinations like grocery stores combined with low transit access to regional destinations like major job centers. This seemingly contradictory outcome arises from the combination of racially segregated land use and the prevalence of rapid, regional-scale transit service in affluent areas. It underscores the importance of measuring people’s transit access to actual destinations: Assessing only transit inputs, such as transit service intensity, is not sufficient to convey the transit outcomes that people experience.</p>

          <p class='flow-text'>Will your train get delayed? Do you catch an early bus so that you’re not late to work if there’s traffic? Reliability, or how well transit service adheres to the schedule, affects access to opportunity. Unreliable transit service limits access by extending travel times — whether because someone’s trip is actually delayed or because they assume it will be and build in extra time for the trip.</p>

          <p class='flow-text'>Buses, which often have to share street space with car traffic, are less reliable than trains, which tend to operate in dedicated rights of way. The disparity is inequitable: Bus riders are more likely than train riders to be people of color and people with low incomes.</p>

      <h2>What Should Transit Agencies Do in Response to These Findings?</h2>
      <p class='flow-text'>Agency decision makers should:
        <ol class='browser-default'>
          <li class='flow-text'>Adopt and publicly publish measures of equitable access on transit.</li>
          <li class='flow-text'>Adjust investments, service, and policy in order to reduce measured gaps in access.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h3 class='left-align'>Measure Equitable Access</h3>
      <p class='flow-text'>The Equity Dashboard measures <i>transit access to opportunity</i> - the ability for people to conveniently reach important destinations via transit. Access-to-opportunity measures are increasingly used in planning because they evaluate the transportation network according to how people experience it in real life, and because advances in computing capacity have made them feasible to calculate. </p>

      <p class='flow-text'>Transit agencies should include these access-to-opportunity measures in equity analysis:
        <ul class='browser-default'>
          <li class='flow-text'>Access to jobs on transit. (<i>For example, how many jobs are accessible by transit in a certain amount of time?</i>)</li>
          <li class='flow-text'>Access to non-work destinations on transit, such as health care, groceries, and parks. (<i>For example, how long is the transit trip to the nearest hospital?</i>)</li>
          <li class='flow-text'>Changes over time in transit access to work and other essential destinations.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class='flow-text'>To evaluate transit equity specifically, transit agencies must <b>disaggregate each access-to-opportunity measure for specific population groups, including</b>:
      <ul class='browser-default'>
        <li class="flow-text">By race and ethnicity</li>
        <li class="flow-text">By income level</li>
        <li class="flow-text">For cost-constrained riders (by calculating access on low-cost transit trips only)</li>
        <li class="flow-text">For riders with disabilities</li>
      </ul> 
      </p>
      <p class="flow-text">Disaggregated measures show how riders of different demographic groups experience transit service, and point to gaps in access that are inequitable.</p>
      <p class='flow-text'>Transit agencies should use these measures to assess current service and future changes to the system. The transit access-to-opportunity measures described above can be replicated by any agency that has a high-quality General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and the capacity to analyze Census data (low-fare metrics and transit-car comparisons require additional data resources).</p>

    <p class='flow-text'>Additionally, transit agencies should adopt the following practices::
      <ul class='browser-default'>
        <li class="flow-text">Make transit equity analysis publicly available, including reporting on these metrics during board meetings</li>
        <li class="flow-text">Plan service enhancements that reduce the identified racial and economic access gaps over time</li>
        <li class="flow-text">Develop an equity strategy grounded in clearly-defined principles and goals</li>
        <li class="flow-text">Adopt public engagement practices that garner representative input</li>
        <li class="flow-text">Create internal working groups and external advisory groups that advance equity across agency functions</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h3 class='left-align'>Change Service and Focus Development to Reduce Access Gaps</h3>
      <p class='flow-text'>Transit agencies should work to close racial access gaps and expand transit access for workers with low incomes and essential workers. Transit service changes alone can’t close the gaps; doing so also requires land use changes. The most effective ways to close gaps will vary by region. However, some general strategies include:
        <ul class='browser-default'>
          <li class="flow-text"><b>Speeding up service</b>: Dedicate lanes on the street for buses and other transit modes.

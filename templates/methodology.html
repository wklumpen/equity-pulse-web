            <h2>What does the TransitCenter Equity Dashboard Do?</h2>
            <p class='flow-text'>The TransitCenter Equity Dashboard tracks how well public transit systems in seven US regions serve their riders, and how changes to transit service affect riders over time. The dashboard measures access to opportunity on transit, transit service intensity and transit affordability for people of color, people living in poverty, essential workers, and other people who rely on transit to meet their daily needs. The dashboard also includes metrics of transit reliability and how travel times to key destinations on transit compare to travel times by car. The dashboard shows these data with a series of charts, interactive maps, and downloadable data sets. Data begin in February 2020 and are included for Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco-Oakland, and Washington D.C.</p>

            <h2>Who made the dasboard?</h2>
            <p class='flow-text'>The TransitCenter Equity Pulse was funded by TransitCenter and was completed in May 2021 by  <a href="http://www.sustainablesystemsresearch.net/">Sustainable Systems Research, LLC</a>, SF2 Enterprises Inc, <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cems/trc">Univeristy of Vermont</a>, and <a href="https://www.klumpentown.com/">Klumpentown Consulting</a>.

            <h3>How do I cite this Dashboard?</h3>
            <p class='flow-text'>Please reference the following paper:</p>

            <p class='flow-text'>Klumpenhouwer, W., Allen, J., Li, L., Liu, R., Da Silva, D. D., Robinson, M., Farber, S., Karner, A., Rowangould, D., Shalaby, A., Buchanan, M., & Higashide, S. (2021). Dashboarding Transit Accessibility and Equity in the United States. <i>Under Preparation</i>.

            <h2>How is the information shown on the Dashboard calculated?</h2>
            <p class='flow-text'>Below we provide a brief description of the methods used to create the dashboard. A more detailed methodology is available upon request. Please contact dashboard@transitcenter.org for more information.</p>

            <p class='flow-text'><b>Accessibility</b> represents the ease with which people can reach the places they want and need to go. Accessibility is a function of transportation and land use (where essential destinations are located). Access to opportunities measures, which represent the ease of reaching a specific type of destination, are a commonly used measure of accessibility. The dashboard evaluates access to opportunity on public transit with several measures, including number of jobs, low-wage jobs, or amount of park space accessible in a set amount of time. The dashboard also shows access to opportunity in terms of the travel times to nearby grocery stores, hospitals, urgent care facilities, pharmacies, and colleges or universities.</p>

            <p class='flow-text'>Measures of public transit accessibility can capture many characteristics of transit systems that affect people’s ability to reach their destinations, including the location of stops and routes, what kinds of destinations can be reached on those routes, the speed or directness of routes, the frequency of service, fares, and time spent walking to and from a transit stop or transferring between routes. We estimate transit and car accessibility by calculating transit and car travel times to the locations of destinations across each region. For some measures, we also estimate accessibility using a fare constraint to represent lower-cost transit travel.</p>

            <p class='flow-text'>Transit travel times between all Census block groups in each region are estimated using the <a href="https://www.opentripplanner.org/">OpenTripPlanner</a> (OTP) tool. OTP uses a detailed pedestrian network from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM). Transit schedules are represented by <a href="https://gtfs.org/">General Transit Feed Specification</a> (GTFS) data for transit operators in each region. These GTFS data are obtained from <a href="https://www.transit.land/">TransitLand</a> and <a href="https://transitfeeds.com/">OpenMobilityData</a>. Transit travel times are capped at 90 minutes and include all parts of a door-to-door trip, including time walking to and from a transit stop, time spent waiting for a transit vehicle, time spent traveling in vehicle(s), and time spent transferring between transit vehicles. Areas where no destination can be reached within 90 minutes are displayed on maps in the "least access" quantile.  Car travel times are estimated using ArcGIS Network Analyst (ArcGIS Pro 2.7) and the ESRI Streetmap Premium network based on <a href="https://www.here.com/">HERE</a> data to represent typical road traffic conditions.</p>

            <p class='flow-text'>Transit fares are estimated using a simplified heuristic. We created a fare calculator that uses OTP to generate detailed transit itineraries for the shortest trip between all Census tracts in each region. The fare calculator estimates the cost of each itinerary based on a database of manually calibrated rules representing fare information from each transit operator’s website. These fare rules include the cost of transfers within and between agencies. In a small number of cases these rules are simplified. We assume that transit travelers pay for a one-way ride with an intermediate purchase choice that is less expensive than cash, such as a ticket or card where available. We assume cash fares where no intermediate choice is available.  We do not include discounted fares like student or senior fares or options that require a large up-front purchase like monthly or weekly passes. The fare constraints used in each region are determined based on the cost of living and base transit fares. They are set at $4 for a one-way trip in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia and $5 in Boston, the District of Columbia, New York City, and San Francisco-Oakland. The fastest transit time between each pair of tracts in the region and its accompanying fare is then estimated for two different transit networks: one that includes only low-cost modes (local bus plus comparable-cost modes) and the other including all modes (all available public transit options). When determining the travel time between two locations, we select the shortest of the two travel times that meets the fare constraint (if applicable). A full list of transit agencies and premium modes (which are excluded from the low-cost travel network) is included <a href="#endnote">below</a>. </p>

            <p class='flow-text'>We consider five categories of destinations. Destinations and data sources include:
                <ul class='browser-default'>
                    <li class='flow-text'>Jobs and low-wage jobs ($1250/month or less): <a href="https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/">US Census LEHD</a></li>
                    <li class='flow-text'>Grocery stores and supermarkets: <a href="https://github.com/jshannon75/snap_retailers">SNAP retailers</a></li>
                    <li class='flow-text'>Healthcare facilities: <a href="https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6ac5e325468c4cb9b905f1728d6fbf0f_0?geometry=91.417%2C-16.829%2C-122.333%2C72.120">hospitals</a>, <a href="https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/urgent-care-facilities">urgent care facilities</a>, and <a href="https://rxopen.org/">pharmacies</a></li>
                    <li class='flow-text'>Parks and other green space (including cemeteries, school yards, etc.): <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> queried with the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API">Overpass API</a>.</li>
                    <li class='flow-text'>Higher education: <a href="https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/colleges-and-universities">colleges and universities</a> and <a href="https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/supplemental-colleges/data">supplemental colleges</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class='flow-text'>We combine travel times (fare-constrained transit, unconstrained transit, and car) and the location of these destinations to estimate how many destinations can be reached in a certain amount of time, e.g. jobs reachable within 30 minutes. These types of accessibility measures are estimated for destination types that are widely available, including jobs, low-wage jobs, and parks and greenspace. The dashboard’s data download also includes a similar gravity-based accessibility measure that uses a continuous decay function to weight opportunities based on how quickly they can be reached.</p>

            <p class='flow-text'>We also estimate travel times reach a certain number of opportunities, e.g. travel time in minutes to one hospital or to three hospitals.  The travel time to one hospital reflects the minimum possible time to reach a hospital. The travel time to three hospitals measures travel time to the third-closest hospital, capturing people’s need for options, where the closest hospital may not match someone’s needs in terms of the cost or type of care provided.  These types of measures are used  for healthcare facilities, grocery stores and supermarkets, and higher education.</p>

            <p class='flow-text'><b>Transit service intensity</b> represents how often an area is served by transit. Using transit schedules from GTFS feeds we estimate the total number of unique transit trips that visit stops within 200 meters of a block group, and estimate the average number of unique trips per hour over a 24-hour period. </p>

            <p class='flow-text'><b>Transit reliability</b> measures evaluate the on-time performance of transit vehicles in a particular transit system, calculated as the fraction of all vehicles in that system that are between 1 minute early and 5 minutes late.  The dashboard shows on-time performance for a select number of transit operators that provide direct reports about the status of delay of every vehicle (e.g., minutes early or late for the next stop) in their real-time GTFS feeds. Where a transit operator does not provide on-time performance we do not report reliability. Available GTFS-realtime and NextBus transit feeds across all regions are sampled on approximately an hourly basis (with exact times randomly picked from each hour). Transit reliability is shown on the Story page. Population and block-group level measures of transit reliability are not available.</p>

            <p class='flow-text'><b>Equity indicators</b> shown on the Story pages summarize population-weighted access and transit service intensity for groups of people, weighting these outcomes based on  where group members live across the entire region (including areas in the MSA, economic region, urban core, and equity neighborhoods). Data on race and ethnicity, income level, and parent-child status are obtained from the 2018 five-year American Community Survey data from the US Census. Essential workers are defined based on residential location of workers listed in the <a href="https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/">US Census LEHD</a> data. The residential locations of each of these populations is also available as a demographic overlay in the map pages. The Story page also evaluates outcomes for people with specific travel constraints, including people traveling with limited fares or people traveling on weeknights.</p>

            <p class='flow-text'>We also evaluate transit accessibility measures relative to car access to provide an indication of equity of access for different mode users.</p>

                The greatest number of jobs are accessible when riding transit during the morning peak. Accessibility is generally lower at night than during morning peak. This indicates that people who commute during peak hours generally have better access to their jobs than people who commute outside those times. The number of accessible jobs is generally lowest for people who only use less expensive transit options, as they cannot afford certain premium transit routes that grant access around the region.
